# FlowUI

FlowUI is a simple presentation toolkit for text-based displays where it is not
possible to move the cursor backwards. All widgets are designed so that they
are rendered one character at a time and assuming the cursor is moved forward
one character each time.


## Requirements

FlowUI has been tested with Python 2.7 and 3.3 on MacOS X and GNU/Linux.
